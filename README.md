# Upper-Limb-Exoskeleton
>Designing, manufacturing(Hardware) and control(Electronics) upper limb Exoskeleton(complex model) using CAD softwares and 3-D Printers. 

## Why this project?
Many people in world suffer from paralysis of body parts like hands, legs, back. So we can develop models like a kind of suit that is wearable and will help people to move their body parts.


## ***My contribution***
In this project my part was to design and manufactured the hardware of exoskeleton and control over it by motors using sensors. 

#### **1. Design**
>It was main problem in desing to build elbow, shoulder joints and back movements that can provide 1, 2, 3 DOF as required. The design should not be such that it's hardware is heavy in weight.

#### **2. Manufacturing Hardware**
>As hardware was to be weared by humna so it must be flexible to provide wrist, elbow, shoulder, back movement properly.

#### **3. Control on hardware(Electronics)**
>The exoskeleton was controlled by geared motors with driver, to provide high torque using Ardiuno Uno. To control the model the amount of hand lift will be measured by amount of angle it rotated. So we here use Potentiometer to measure the angle. As only elbow can't rotate in complete circle so we need to give restrcition to arm so it does not move completely. We do this by controlling motors and using potentiometer as feedback provider for angle measurement.
