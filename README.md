# Upper-Limb-Exoskeleton
>Designing, manufacturing(Hardware) and control(Electronics) upper limb Exoskeleton(complex model) using CAD softwares and 3-D Printers. 

## ***My contribution***
In this project, my part was to design and manufacture the hardware of the exoskeleton and control it by motors using sensors. 

#### **1. Design**
>It was the main problem in designing to build elbow, shoulder joints and back movements that can provide 1, 2, and 3 DOF as required. The design should not be such that its hardware is heavy in weight.

#### **2. Manufacturing Hardware**
>As hardware was to be worn by humans, it must be flexible to provide wrist, elbow, shoulder, and back movement properly.

#### **3. Control on hardware(Electronics)**
>The exoskeleton was controlled by geared motors with the driver, to provide high torque using Arduino Uno. To control the model, the amount of hand lift will be measured by the amount of angle it rotates. So here we used a Potentiometer to measure the angle. As only the elbow can't rotate in a complete circle, we need to give restrictions to the arm so it does not move completely. We do this by controlling motors and using a potentiometer as a feedback provider for angle measurement.
