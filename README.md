# Upper-Limb-Exoskeleton
>Designing, manufacturing(Hardware) and control(Electronics) upper limb Exoskeleton(complex model) using CAD softwares and 3-D Printers. 

## Why this project?
Many people in world suffer from paralysis of body parts like hands, legs, back. So we can develop models like a kind of suit that is wearable and will help people to move their body parts.


## ***My contribution***
In this project my part was to design and manufactured the hardware of exoskeleton and control over it by motors using sensors. 

#### **1. Design**
>It was main problem in desing to build elbow, shoulder joints and back movements that can provide 1, 2, 3 DOF as required. The design should not be such that it's hardware is heavy in weight.

>Few parts designed by me:-

#### **2. Manufacturing Hardware**
>As hardware was to be weared by humna so it must be flexible to provide wrist, elbow, shoulder, back movement properly.
#### **3. Control on hardware(Electronics)**
>The exoskeleton was controlled by geared motors, to provide high torque.
